# glitch_tools
This repository holds a re-invented set of Python tools used for the collection, processing and analysis of glitch/pulsar data from the JBCA and ATNF catalogues. They are loosely based on the code used in Yim, Shao &amp; Xu (2024) but re-written using newly learnt data science tools and packages. 

Packages used include:
- Pandas
- Beautiful Soup (for webscrapping)
- Scikit-learn
